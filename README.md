# Currently this is the available bugfix (*support library rev. 23.0.1*)
So, Google gives us a solution which I think is not ideal but works. According to this, instead of using

```xml
<item name="preferenceTheme">@style/PreferenceThemeOverlay</item>
```

one should use

```xml
<item name="preferenceTheme">@style/PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material</item>
```

This also means that even though you are using only v7, you have to include the v14 lib as well because the said `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material` is only available in it.

**Another bug** is that on API levels below 21 the PreferenceCategory elements' text color is not the accent color you define in your style. To set it to your accent color, you have to define a `preference_fallback_accent_color` color value in any of your resources files. Example:

```xml
<resources>
    <color name="accent">#FF4081</color>
    <!-- this is needed as preference_category_material layout uses this color as the text color -->
    <color name="preference_fallback_accent_color">@color/accent</color>
</resources>
```

**And another bug** is that the PreferenceCategory's text style is *italic* instead of **bold**. In order to fix this, you have to re-define a so-called `Preference_TextAppearanceMaterialBody2` style (this is used by the PreferenceCategory below API level 21) in any of your styles file:

```xml
<style name="Preference_TextAppearanceMaterialBody2">
    <item name="android:textSize">14sp</item>
    <item name="android:fontFamily">sans-serif-medium</item>
    <item name="android:textStyle">bold</item>
    <item name="android:textColor">?android:attr/textColorPrimary</item>
</style>
```

**And one more bug** is that `PreferenceThemeOverlay.v14.Material` has no correct background selector. To overcome this, you should add the following line to your main theme style:

```xml
<item name="android:activatedBackgroundIndicator">?android:attr/selectableItemBackground</item>
```

*Note that I did not test this background-fixer solution extensively so it might mess up other parts of your app. This is just a temporary (i.e. experimental) bugfix until Google releases either a less buggy version of the lib or the source code so we could fix it.*

**And another bug (*officially it isn't*)** is that you cannot set any `EditText`-related attributes (e.g. `inputType`) to your `EditTextPreference`. If you still want to do that, scroll down a little, the workaround is in the **Interesting things** part.

# Interesting things
These are not considered bugs but they can give you a headache.

### Creating Preference programmatically
When you create a `Preference`, you have to pass a context to its constructor. When you pass context by calling `getActivity()` or `getContext()` on your `PreferenceFragmentCompat`, you give the newly created `Preference` a context which is not styled with your `preferenceTheme` but your Activity's main theme. To pass the right context object, you have to do this:

```java
Context ctx = getPreferenceManager().getContext();

Preference preference = new Preference(ctx);
// setup your preference and add it to a category or the preference screen
```
And voil√†, now your `preference` instance is material styled (*or whatever style you set as your `preferenceTheme`'s `preferenceStyle`*).

### Setting `InputType` and other `EditText`-related attributes on EditTextPreference
`EditTextPreference` doesn't forward XML attributes that should influence the input type or other aspects of the shown `EditText`. The [official statement](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=185164) is that this is *not a bug*, but I think it's a serious design flaw. Anyways, after a few hours getting through the decompiled source, I came up with a solution that works for now.

I introduced 3 new (*fix*) classes:

- **`EditTextPreferenceFix`** replacing `EditTextPreference` (in your XML too)
- **`EditTextPreferenceDialogFragmentCompatFix`** replacing `EditTextPreferenceDialogFragmentCompat`, you won't interact with it, just needed for the fixed experience
- **`PreferenceFragmentCompatFix`** replacing `PreferenceFragmentCompat` as the base class of `MyPreferenceFragment`

You need a few updates to utilize this fix.

Update `MyPreferenceFragment`'s base class to `PreferenceFragmentCompatFix` (*note the __Fix__ ending*):
```java
public class MyPreferenceFragment extends PreferenceFragmentCompatFix { /* ... */ }
```

In your preference XML, use `EditTextPreferenceFix` instead of `EditTextPreference` (*again, note the __Fix__ ending*):
```xml
<EditTextPreferenceFix
    android:inputType="phone"
    android:key="edit_text_fix_test"
    android:persistent="false"
    android:summary="It's an input for phone numbers only"
    android:title="EditTextPreferenceFix" />
```

*I recommend using the normal `EditTextPreference` version first as it provides auto-complete for the attributes, and adding the __Fix__ ending when you're testing / releasing the app.*

If you use `EditTextPreferenceFix`, you can also access the shown `EditText` by calling the preference's `getEditText()` method. Example:
```java
EditTextPreferenceFix etPref = (EditTextPreferenceFix) findPreference("edit_text_fix_test");
int inputType = etPref.getEditText().getInputType();
```

# Known bugs that cannot be fixed
- When a Preference's dialog is showing and the device's orientation changes, the app crashes. [Bug report](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=186160)

# Android-Support-Preference-V7-Fix
~~Android preference-v7 support library doesn't contain material design layout files so the preferences screen looks bad on API 21+. This is a temporary fix until Google fixes it.~~

The latest (23.0.1) preference-v7 support library has some other issues, see above.

The issue has been reported, you can find it here:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=183376

# Prerequisites #
This demo / bugfix is set to work on API level 16+.

# License notes #
You can do whatever you want except where noted, especially the following files downloaded from the [Android framework base](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/tree/master/core/res/res/layout) (these are also modified):
 - preference_category_material_custom.xml
 - preference_dialog_edittext_material_custom.xml
 - preference_information_material_custom.xml
